Specifically, in this course the students are taken through a weekly experiential learning routine in the tutorial/assignment class.The experiential learning assignment involves a problem on machine component design fit for maximum 50 min (sometimes I found 50 min to be insufficient!). The assignment sheet requires each student enter his name and ID at the beginning of the session hence exchange is prohibited.Prescribed textbook containing data tables, one’s own class notes, PPT slide printouts (no laptops!), calculator and any other printed material are permitted. No more than 2 students are allowed to sit on each desk. Those two can discuss between themselves but may not discuss with anyone across. They can seek the help of the tutorial instructors any time.
