Research
Area: Structural
Biology, Protein Folding/mis-folding and therapeutics, Protein Design,
Molecular Self-assembly & peptide-based materials                     Our research interests are in the broad area of structural biology with an emphasis on protein folding, stability, design and molecular self-assembly of peptide-based materials. To address these questions, we employ biophysical and spectroscopic approaches (circular dichroism, fluorescence and NMR). In addition, we also employ molecular dynamics and bioinformatics to extract and understand the basic aspects of protein structure, stability, folding and function.  EFFECTS OF MOLECULAR CROWDING ON STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF PROTEINS Although structure, shape, stability and function of proteins are better understood in diluted buffers, the consequences of cellular crowding are still not clear. Contrasting observations are observed implying the role of both volume exclusion (entropic) and soft interactions (enthalpic) in modulating protein structure and stability. In this context, we are focusing on the molecular origins of the modulation of structure and stability as a consequence of crowding, under in vitro and ‘in cell’ conditions. Our objective, especially, to extract structural and thermodynamic insights under in-cell conditions is, un-doubtfully challenging. However, such information can lead to new avenues in extending our understanding in ‘in-cell’ conditions. Eventually, it is desirable to relate the structure - function relationship of proteins, biomolecular interactions, including protein-drug interactions etc., happening inside the cellular environment.  PEPTIDE BASED (Nano) MATERIALS: DESIGN & APPLICATIONSThe field of peptide based self-assembled amyloid biomaterials with specific applications in various fields, via functionalization is emerging rapidly.  Pollution of air, water, soil and food is now perceived as a major threat which demands aggressive options for decontamination and remediation.   Our lab is interested in designing highly efficient self-assembled peptide amyloid biomaterial using genetic engineering approach followed by structural and morphological characterization. The self-assembled biomaterial will then be functionalized by judicious placement of amino acids for binding to specific substrates such as metal ions PROTEIN MIS-FOLDING Aggregation and amyloid formation Our laboratory is also interested in understanding the mis-folding and formation of amyloids and in identifying therapeutic methods to prevent the formation of amyloids. Specifically, we are interested in identifying potential leads for Alzheimer’s disease by targeting the relevant enzymes involved in the disease progression as well as in identifying small molecules that can destabilize amyloid fibrils.  Development of molecules with (i) Inhibitory action, against enzymes(s) targets and (ii) Destabilization/prevention of amyloids that may prove to be a better therapeutic option. A combination of modeling, molecular dynamics and experimental approaches are being employed to comprehend the important interactions that can be further considered for lead optimization. DESIGN OF INDEPENDENTLY FOLDING PROTEIN MOTIFS Another very important area of our research efforts is protein design and engineering. Amino acid sequence dictates protein structure which in turn is responsible for function. The combination of the secondary structures, a-helices and b-sheets, connected by turns/loops form structural motifs such as b hairpins, helical hairpins coiled coils, babunits etc., serve as basic building blocks for the four major protein folds, a, b, a/b and a+b.  Lessons learnt from analyzing protein structures and principles of protein folding have guided efforts to design independently folding a-helices, b-hairpins, aa hairpins, bba motifs and helical proteins.  We are interested in deciphering the features  that allow independently folding sequences. Further, protein loops are being targeted for grafting/designing to create novel or alter existing functionality, improve stability and foldability. We have developed databases and web servers which are proving to be useful in providing a basis for incorporating consensus loop sequences for loop exchanging and creation of new enzymatic functions.    JRF POSITION AVAILABLE IN BNRS SPONSORED PROJECT.   For complete details follow the link:https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/uploads/BPHC_2019/ADVERTISEMENT_BRNS_Feb2019_2nd.pdf Students with CSIR/DBT/ICMR/Inspire fellowships, NET qualified are encouraged to apply.
