Prior to joining BITS-Pilani, he was Postdoctoral Research Associate in the CEHMS, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Tech (VT), USA (From 2014 to 2015). At VT, his one of the research work was focused on energy efficient ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) and memristors for resistive RAM (ReRAM) applications (along with AMRDEC, US Army Lab researchers). Apart from the memory device research work, he also investigated the photovoltaic properties of ferroelectric materials (along with NREL researchers) and his main aim was to improve the performance parameters for ferroelectric solar cells through interfacial engineering with semiconductors. He was also engaged in research consultancy on fabrication of silica diaphragm MEMS based pressure sensor with SA Photonics, California. Before joining VT, Souvik was responsible for carrying out research and development of flexible dual-function glucose sensors and hormone delivery catheter for use within an artificial pancreas. He worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Oregon State University, USA. He was also involved to perform research consultancy on glucose sensing catheter with Pacific Diabetes Technologies, Portland. Souvik also worked on organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells and quantum dots embedded non-volatile memory at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay before moving to USA. He proposed the device operation mechanism and formulated many new ideas to improve the performances in III-V MOS based flash memory devices. He earned his Ph.D. (August, 2009 – 2012) from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur and his thesis work was on interface engineering in GaAs metal-oxide-semiconductor devices for improving its electrical performances. During his Ph.D., he also carried out several other research projects, viz. GaAs MOS based flash memory, Direct growth of InP quantum dots on Si for monolithic integration, MOCVD grown ZnO nanorods- its doping behavior, electrical transport properties and applications in sensors, ZnO based thin-film transistors and hybrid Schottky devices. He has established many exciting ideas to develop the device fabrication principles and novel design concepts for future generation microelectronic devices. He also proposed new physics in order to understand the operation principles of such devices.     Souvik is interested in exploring new materials for electronic, photovoltaic & photonic applications; artificial neural network, epitaxial growth of semiconducting and ferroelectric materials; novel fabrication techniques and novel device concepts for future nanoelectronics. Presently, he is supervising 6 Ph.D. students (1 submitted thesis) and already supervised 10 B.Tech thesis and many LOP-DOP-SOP (projects). He has published over 43 international journal papers in reputed journals (such as Nature, IEEE, IET, IOP, AIP, ACS, Springer, Elsevier, etc.), 2 book chapters for Springer & Elsevier, and presented his work in 14 international conferences in USA, Italy, Switzerland, Hong-Kong, Singapore and India during last few years. He also delivered few invited lectures hosted by different institutes in India and USA, such as University of Texas, San Antonio, IISc Bangalore, IIT-Bombay, TIFR-Mumbai, Calcutta University, IIT Indore, University of Hyderabad, etc.  How to Contact?  Mail/Stop by: Office: H-230Department of Electrical & Electronics EngineeringBirla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS) - Pilani (Hyderabad Campus)Jawahar Nagar, Kapra MandalHyderabad - 500078, Telangana, India Email: souvik.kundu at hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in Voice (Direct): +91-40-66303681   (For any kind of communication, Email is preferred unless phone call gets priority over the former one)   "Enjoy your life and work, always live a balanced life"
