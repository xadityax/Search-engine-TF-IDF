                                Research Interest



My research interest deals with the development of novel nanoparticular and macromolecular drug delivery systems  mainly liposomes, polymeric micelles and dendrimers loaded with or conjugated to poorly soluble chemotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer with the aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the conventional chemotherapy. One of the major issues of cancer treatment is non-specific toxicity. My research interest gears towards addressing challenges associated with improving pharmacokinetics, bioavailability and reducing off-target effects of existing chemotherapy.We aim to address the challenges associated with existing chemotherapy by imparting various functionalities to the drug delivery system including long systemic circulation, enhanced organ/tissue recognition, improved cellular internalization and delivery to the subcellular organelles. We are  also interested in developing cationic polymer conjugated lipid based siRNA and siRNA/drug co-delivery systems as treatment modality for cancer.
