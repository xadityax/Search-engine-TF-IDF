Database TechnologiesData Management in Wireless Sensor Networks

 A. Database Systems store important and valuable data pertaining to an organization. We work on the following issues- (i) Query processing schemes which help in improving the performance of the system that leads to greater satisfaction of the user. (ii) Database Tuning is the process that involves analyzing the performance of the database system after its deployment, and applying necessary changes to schema, indexing, storage plan etc. to achieve higher performance.  (iii) Database security is need of the hour in present day Information systems, which is necessary to safeguard the sensitive and valuable data of an organization from unintended theft, updates, loss, denial of access to legitimate users etc. B. Data Management in Wireless Sensor Networks
The main focus of this  research is on the Data Management in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Due to the fact that the communication activity is a dominant source of energy consumption in a WSN, it is essential to minimize the number of messages exchanged in wireless sensor networks. The external entities submit their requests for data, to the base-station. Base-station then disseminates the query in required form to the concerned nodes in the network. The nodes respond to this and send the results back to the base-station from where it is transmitted to the external applications/users. The data extraction from nodes may be either pull-based or push-based. In the first approach, the base-station issues ad-hoc queries to nodes, and in the second approach, sensor nodes keep sending the data to the base-station according to some predefined scheme. In one of the data dissemination techniques, nodes in a network form a tree structure (routing tree) to handle query/data transmissions. There exist a number of tree-based routing schemes. Normally, the base-station is considered to be the root of the routing tree. As part of the data management in WSNs, we focus  on the following issues.Efficient routing schemes to minimize transmission overheads.Data compression to achieve reduced number of packets.Exploit query containment to minimize the query evaluation and transmission overheads.Effective and efficient data storage and retrieval schemes.Distributed query evaluation.Efficient user query interface to Data in WSNs.

Database TechnologiesData Management in Wireless Sensor Networks

 A. Database Systems store important and valuable data pertaining to an organization. We work on the following issues- (i) Query processing schemes which help in improving the performance of the system that leads to greater satisfaction of the user. (ii) Database Tuning is the process that involves analyzing the performance of the database system after its deployment, and applying necessary changes to schema, indexing, storage plan etc. to achieve higher performance.  (iii) Database security is need of the hour in present day Information systems, which is necessary to safeguard the sensitive and valuable data of an organization from unintended theft, updates, loss, denial of access to legitimate users etc. B. Data Management in Wireless Sensor Networks
The main focus of this  research is on the Data Management in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Due to the fact that the communication activity is a dominant source of energy consumption in a WSN, it is essential to minimize the number of messages exchanged in wireless sensor networks. The external entities submit their requests for data, to the base-station. Base-station then disseminates the query in required form to the concerned nodes in the network. The nodes respond to this and send the results back to the base-station from where it is transmitted to the external applications/users. The data extraction from nodes may be either pull-based or push-based. In the first approach, the base-station issues ad-hoc queries to nodes, and in the second approach, sensor nodes keep sending the data to the base-station according to some predefined scheme. In one of the data dissemination techniques, nodes in a network form a tree structure (routing tree) to handle query/data transmissions. There exist a number of tree-based routing schemes. Normally, the base-station is considered to be the root of the routing tree. As part of the data management in WSNs, we focus  on the following issues.Efficient routing schemes to minimize transmission overheads.Data compression to achieve reduced number of packets.Exploit query containment to minimize the query evaluation and transmission overheads.Effective and efficient data storage and retrieval schemes.Distributed query evaluation.Efficient user query interface to Data in WSNs.
