It involves design aspects, and deals with the current trends in computing architecture. System resources such as memory technology and I/O subsystems needed to achieve proportional increase in performance will also be discussed. Course 2: CS C471/IS F311 Computer Graphics (2015-16 Ist sem, 2014-15 Ist Sem, 2013-14 Ist Sem, 2012-13 Ist Sem)Objective: is to introduce the concepts of computer graphics through theoretical, algorithmic and advanced modeling aspects along with, applications in 3D graphics and visualization. This course is also covering part of OpenGL for graphics. After successful completion of the course student should be able to apply the concepts and techniques to various problem domain and visualization of data sets and processes. Course 3: CS G526 Advanced Algorithms & Complexity (2015-16 Ist sem, 2014-15 Ist Sem, 2013-14 Ist Sem, 2012-13 Ist Sem)Objective: is to enable students to explore advanced topics in algorithmic and complexity theory; engage in analysis and design of complex algorithms for real-world problems in application domains; learn and evaluate advanced / novel algorithm design strategies (Randomized algorithms mostly) and techniques; and understand sturdy / open problems in algorithmic or complexity theory by analyzing known approaches and their limitations. Course 4: IS F242 Computer Organization (2013-14 IInd sem)The course aims at understanding the important components of a computing system, how these components are interrelated. Also it attempts to look at the problems and methods of designing computers like pipelining, RISC architectures and parallel processing architectures. The treatment on the architecture is general and not specific to a particular processor.    Course 5: IS F364 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (2014-15 IInd sem, 2013-14 IInd sem) The objective of the course is to introduce students to different paradigm of algorithms and various techniques to analyze them. The analysis is of the correctness of the algorithm and the time complexity (also space complexity). They will also learn about the computational intractability; a class of NP-complete problems and techniques to prove NP-completeness. They will learn major techniques to deal with such computationally intractable set of problems. Course 6:  CS F111 Computer Programming (2014-15 IInd Sem)The primary goals of the course are to introduce:Basic representation of data and how to process data using the representation inside a computer.Techniques for specifying data, operations on data, and problem solving using a programming language.Systematic techniques and approaches for constructing programs.

Current Research Goals:The focus area of my research work is mesh generation which spans variety of problem domains starting from CAD Model meshing to fluid flow simulation. In particular Delaunay based methods for mesh generation are to be deeply studied, along with their scalability issues. I would like to use the meshes in actual simulation process and analyse the quality of result. The meshes can be of surfaces as well as volumes enclosed by a model. The topological correctness along with a good geometric approximation of the output mesh of the input model is to be ensured.   Other Research Activities:Member of the editorial board of Journal of Computational Design and Engineering, Techno-Press, South-Korea.  Previous Research Activities: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NYScientific Computation Research Center                                             Advisor: Prof Mark Shephard Given a multi-material domain voxel data where unlike scalar data, each voxel contained the information about the fraction of the volume of at the most two materials, thus having ambiguities in the data where more than two material regions intersect a voxel makes the problem harder. Developing and implementing an algorithm to construct a boundary representation from such voxel data of multi-material regions such that every shell of a material region is closed and there are no voids between adjacent shells.The Ohio State University, Columbus, OHDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering                             Advisor: Prof Tamal K. DeyDeveloped and implemented algorithm called QUALMESH to generate a tetrahedral mesh of the volume enclosed by a polyhedral domain. This algorithm can be used even when the polyhedral domain contains sharp input angles. The generated mesh will have most of the tetrahedra with good radius to shortest edge length ratio (also called as aspect ratio). There will be some skinny tetrahedra with bad aspect ratio left but they will be provably close to the small input angles.The volume mesh obtained from QUALMESH may contain some tetrahedra, called slivers, whose dihedral angle is very small even though its aspect ratio is good. We developed and implemented WQUALMESH to remove as many slivers as possible. There may remain some close to the small input angles.Developed and implemented an algorithm called POLYSURFMESH to generate a triangular mesh of surface of a polyhedral domain. This algorithm is a modification of QUALMESH and hence can be used to mesh the surface of a polygonal domain with small input angles. Both QUALMESH and POLYSURFMESH preserves all the input edges and facets.    Developed an implemented an algorithm called SURFREMESH to re-mesh a polygonal surface approximating a smooth surface with guarantees on the aspect ratio of the triangles of the mesh and guarantees on the geometrical approximation of the input surface.

Current Research Goals:The focus area of my research work is mesh generation which spans variety of problem domains starting from CAD Model meshing to fluid flow simulation. In particular Delaunay based methods for mesh generation are to be deeply studied, along with their scalability issues. I would like to use the meshes in actual simulation process and analyse the quality of result. The meshes can be of surfaces as well as volumes enclosed by a model. The topological correctness along with a good geometric approximation of the output mesh of the input model is to be ensured.   Other Research Activities:Member of the editorial board of Journal of Computational Design and Engineering, Techno-Press, South-Korea.  Previous Research Activities: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NYScientific Computation Research Center                                             Advisor: Prof Mark Shephard Given a multi-material domain voxel data where unlike scalar data, each voxel contained the information about the fraction of the volume of at the most two materials, thus having ambiguities in the data where more than two material regions intersect a voxel makes the problem harder. Developing and implementing an algorithm to construct a boundary representation from such voxel data of multi-material regions such that every shell of a material region is closed and there are no voids between adjacent shells.The Ohio State University, Columbus, OHDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering                             Advisor: Prof Tamal K. DeyDeveloped and implemented algorithm called QUALMESH to generate a tetrahedral mesh of the volume enclosed by a polyhedral domain. This algorithm can be used even when the polyhedral domain contains sharp input angles. The generated mesh will have most of the tetrahedra with good radius to shortest edge length ratio (also called as aspect ratio). There will be some skinny tetrahedra with bad aspect ratio left but they will be provably close to the small input angles.The volume mesh obtained from QUALMESH may contain some tetrahedra, called slivers, whose dihedral angle is very small even though its aspect ratio is good. We developed and implemented WQUALMESH to remove as many slivers as possible. There may remain some close to the small input angles.Developed and implemented an algorithm called POLYSURFMESH to generate a triangular mesh of surface of a polyhedral domain. This algorithm is a modification of QUALMESH and hence can be used to mesh the surface of a polygonal domain with small input angles. Both QUALMESH and POLYSURFMESH preserves all the input edges and facets.    Developed an implemented an algorithm called SURFREMESH to re-mesh a polygonal surface approximating a smooth surface with guarantees on the aspect ratio of the triangles of the mesh and guarantees on the geometrical approximation of the input surface.
