B S A S Rajita          Research Topic: Analysis of Temporally Evolving Social Network Patterns         Abstract:            Social network analysis (SNA) is a process of analysis of a social network. An important area of interest    in    Social Network Analysis relates to social network communities, for example how patterns evolve in these communities over a time, analysis of social community structure and uncovering patterns of interaction among social structure entities. We propose to investigate different techniques for identifying temporal patterns and events in social networks that evolve over time. We present a framework for detecting the evolution of dynamic social communities, along with tracking the events and transitions related to communities. These events can be considered as building blocks for pattern detection in networks with evolving communities. These detected events and transitions could then be used for predicting the future patterns of these social networks. The aim of our analyses is to gain insights related to key questions that pertain to the dynamics of the specific network and also possibly for predicting the future patterns of these social networks and infer valuable insights from it.  Soumya Prakash Otta          Research Topic: Security as a Service: Secured Authentication in a Hybrid Cloud Environment.                            Abstract:             To design and implement Security as a service by ensuring and maintaining confidentiality, integrity and   availability as well as strict policy based authentication to access control in a hybrid cloud environment.  Deepa KumariPriyanka Gupta

B S A S Rajita          Research Topic: Analysis of Temporally Evolving Social Network Patterns         Abstract:            Social network analysis (SNA) is a process of analysis of a social network. An important area of interest    in    Social Network Analysis relates to social network communities, for example how patterns evolve in these communities over a time, analysis of social community structure and uncovering patterns of interaction among social structure entities. We propose to investigate different techniques for identifying temporal patterns and events in social networks that evolve over time. We present a framework for detecting the evolution of dynamic social communities, along with tracking the events and transitions related to communities. These events can be considered as building blocks for pattern detection in networks with evolving communities. These detected events and transitions could then be used for predicting the future patterns of these social networks. The aim of our analyses is to gain insights related to key questions that pertain to the dynamics of the specific network and also possibly for predicting the future patterns of these social networks and infer valuable insights from it.  Soumya Prakash Otta          Research Topic: Security as a Service: Secured Authentication in a Hybrid Cloud Environment.                            Abstract:             To design and implement Security as a service by ensuring and maintaining confidentiality, integrity and   availability as well as strict policy based authentication to access control in a hybrid cloud environment.  Deepa KumariPriyanka Gupta
