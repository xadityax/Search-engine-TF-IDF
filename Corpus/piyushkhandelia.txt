Skeletal muscle is not only the largest secretory organ of our body which is critical for growth and energy metabolism, it is also the site of action of several metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes and muscle wasting associated with chronic disorders like cancer. Development of skeletal muscle i.e. skeletal myogenesis and the disorders associated with it involve dramatic changes in the cellular gene expression patterns at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. My laboratory is interested in specific post-transcriptional regulatory processes, namely reversible RNA modifications i.e. epitranscriptomics and RNA degradation mediated by the RNA exosome multiprotein complex. By focusing on these regulatory events, we hope to expand our knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal myogenesis and possibly contribute to development of novel therapies for disorders associated with skeletal muscle.
