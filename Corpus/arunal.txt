About the Faculty
Aruna Lolla was born and brought up in a south Indian City, Hyderabad.  She did a part of her schooling in Delhi and completed the rest of her education in Hyderabad   obtaining all her degrees from Osmania University.   She got her Bachelor’s degree in 1997 in the subjects of Applied Nutrition,  Botany and Chemistry.  She  then shifted to English Literature for  post graduation  in 1997-99 studying diverse fields of English Language Teaching, Grammar, Linguistics and Literatures  of Britain, America and commonwealth countries.    She worked on the poetry of two of the major spiritual stalwarts of modern India, viz., Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo for her doctoral research and was admitted to the degree of Ph.D. in the year 2006. An ardent student of Srimad Bhagavad Gita from early age, she also studied some select Upanishads,  parts of Rig Veda and various schools of Indian Philosophy as a part of her research.
 
From the year 2005 onwards, she has been working as a Language teacher and   trainer in the area of Communication skills in the job titles of Assistant and Associate Professors.  Between 2005-10 she worked with different professional Colleges, affiliated to Jawaharlal  Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad and handled students pursuing the courses of B.Tech. M.C.A. and M.B.A.  She then worked with the University of Hyderabad (July 2010 to Nov, 2011) as a Guest Faculty and trained the students of B.Sc., B.A., M.Tech and M.C.A.  During her tenure with the UoH, she took initiative to organize a mock interview for the MCA students as a confidence building measure to face job interviews.    Her experience and suggestions in this regard have been published in TPLS (Theory and Practice in Language Studies). In the area of Communication Skill,
she has written two papers: one on "Improving Communication Skills in English of the Technical
Students through Learner Centered Approach”
and the other on "Need to Design a Literature based Syllabus for Students
of Professional Courses".
 
She joined BITS in December 2011 and has been teaching courses pertaining to Communication skills like Technical Report Writing and Effective Public Speaking and courses of Philosophy like Srimad Bhagavad Gita.
 
Her research in the field of Literature started with an analysis of language of Literature, language used for recording spiritual experiences(which are sometimes ineffable) and a survey of early  Indian English Poetry with a special focus on Sarojini Naidu's poetry. She is currently working on the Malabar literature along with a research scholar.
 
In the area of Spiritual Science, she took up a field based research on the effect of Mantras. This work studied the impact of the regular listening of mantras on the psychological well being of college students. Student volunteers felt a general improvement in clarity of mind and management of emotions. They also felt an increase in general cheerfulness and ef?ciency, after the 60-day mantra listening. Through this study it was found that mantras are one of the tools useful for managing the mind. By a regular listening, one can find improvement in conditions like depression and anxiety and also enhance positive traits and a sense of well being. 
 
She looks forward to exploring profoundly into Nature and Pantheistic Poetry.
