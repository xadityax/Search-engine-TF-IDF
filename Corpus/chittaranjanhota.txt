1.(IoT Security) Title: Lightweight Code Self-verification for Internet of Things (IoT) Devices, funded by MeitY-NWO under Indo-Dutch Joint Research programme for ICT, (2015-2020), Project outlay: 380, 000 Euros (INR 2.6 Crores).  Principal Investigators: Prof. Herbert Bos (Vrije University, Amsterdam), Prof. Chittaranjan Hota (BITS-Hyderabad)  Executive Summary: The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects (things) embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity modules to enable these objects to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with other connected devices. The IoT paradigm has been emerging for decades, with origins in factory automation, and embedded systems. The fascinating opportunities available through the usage of IoT today, could take any developing country’s economy to a larger sustainable economy by reducing food wastage, reducing energy consumption etc. Along with massive deployment of IoT systems come massive problems. The operation of IoT devices in non-controlled, possibly hostile environments puts the dependability and reliability of IoT systems at stake. More specifically, adversaries may tamper with the devices, intervene their communication channels or clone the devices, to instrument (engineer) the data gathering and overall operation of IoT systems to their own interest. The key idea of this proposal is to use the advanced exploitation technique of Return Oriented Programming (ROP), not as an offensive mechanism, but rather as a defensive weapon, to protect programs running in hostile and possibly resource constrained IoT environments against tampering by adversaries. Specifically, our code verification approach will protect code running on IoT devices by overlapping ROP gadgets (ROP chain) within the code. These translated functions will implicitly verify the integrity of the protected code, by malfunctioning if the ROP gadgets are tampered with, effectively acting as self-verifying code.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 





                                Completed Projects


1. (Cyber Security) Title: Automated Detection of Security and Privacy Threats in Peer-to-Peer Networks, funded by DeitY, Ministry of Communication & Information Technology, Govt. of India, New Delhi, March 2012, (March,2012 - June,2015), Amount: 61,95,000 INR. (Principal Investigator: Chittaranjan Hota). Executive Summary:  With the proliferation of P2P systems, it is critical to consider the impact of these systems on the security of an Internet environment that is already struggling from several security issues. The Indian IT act 2000 and 2008 have provisions for punishing cyber-crimes like hacking, denial of service, breach of confidentiality, publishing of fake digital certificate etc. Other developing, and developed countries have more or less similar regulations. However, most of the countries have less stringent regulations on P2P application usage. Empirical studies indicate that P2P and Web traffic together dominate today's Internet traffic. Currently, products like Snort, Sourcefire VRT etc. detect and alert policy violations for usage of P2P applications using techniques like port-based analysis, and protocol analysis. In this research, we have developed a research prototype to assess the impact of P2P traffic on perimeter security appliance, and also developed intelligent approaches to counter their impact on a large campus wide network.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. (Overlay Search) Title: Efficient Peer-to-Peer Overlay Infrastructure for Secure Computing
over the Internet, funded by University
Grants Commission (UGC),
Govt. of India, New Delhi: (2011 - 2014), Amount: 12,50,000 INR. (Principal
Investigator: Chittaranjan Hota) SUMMARY REPORT:OBJECTIVES: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks which connect peers on top of physical networks like IP, and be it over a wired or over a wireless medium, are growing dramatically in their usage. P2P application usage has grown steadily since its inception around the year 2000. Client-server based architectures are characterized by asymmetric relationship between client and server where client queries and server responds. Contrast to that in distributed P2P systems every node acts as both a server and a client. Peer-to-Peer overlay structure is brought to popularity by the file sharing applications like Napster, Gnutella etc. A P2P overlay network is a logical network built at application layer providing connectivity, routing, and messaging amongst addressable end-points of the communication. These overlay networks have been used for file sharing (torrents), voice over P2P (Skype), and streaming media (P2Pstream) in recent times. The spring 2011 global Internet phenomena report by Canadian ISP Sandvine points to the increased percentage of P2P traffic in North American fixed access networks from 15.1% in 2009 to 18.8% in 2011. In this project, authors have tried to achieve the following two objectives that are critical in improving the performance of large scale file sharing P2P overlays: A.To analyze existing protocols for location management (lookup problem) in peer-to-peer overlays and propose efficient approaches to reduce overlay maintenance cost and network congestion. Under this objective, the main goal is to develop lookup algorithms to optimize the decision making process at each peer by considering the locally available information at each peer like files uploaded/downloaded, bandwidth available, etc. and global information available like type of files at other peers, congestion in the network, replica availability at other peers etc. The target overlay is this research is unstructured P2P overlays mainly file sharing overlay networks.B.To propose novel algorithms to safeguard against Sybil attacks in Peer-to-Peer unstructured overlay networks. Sybil attacks are a major source of concern in any collaborative activity, and particularly in a file sharing P2P network. These attacks are mounted on a sophisticated scale where the attacker stills multiple identities and uses those to disturb the collaborative work. Using Sybil attack, attacker can spoil byzantine consensus, can drop forwarding packets to the neighbor peer, can forward the packets in a wrong route etc. Our objective in this part of the project to either detect these Sybil identities or reduce their impact on the overlay services.

A. Data Structures and Algorithms (CS F211): Pl. click here to go to the course page. Scope: A data structure is a collection of large amounts of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied on them. In order to be effective, data has to be organized in a manner that adds to the effectiveness of an algorithm, and data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, heaps, trees, and graphs provide different capabilities to organize and manage large amounts of data. While developing a program or an application, many developers find themselves more interested in the type of algorithm used rather than the type of data structure implemented. However, the choice of data structure used for a particular algorithm is always of paramount importance. For example, B-trees have unique abilities to organize indexes and hence are well suited for implementation of databases; Linked lists are well suited for backtracking algorithms like, accessing previous and next pages in a web browser; Graphs are well suited for path optimization algorithms (like in Google maps) or searching in a Social graph (like Facebook). As computers have become faster and faster, the problems they must solve have become larger and more complex, requiring development of more complex programs. Through this course, students will learn better programming and algorithm analysis skills using C++.   B. Computer Programming (CS F111): Pl click here to go to the course page.   Scope: This is an introductory course to computers and programming in ‘C’. This course uses a bottom-up approach to teach the beginners what is the structure of a computer and how it can be programmed. It also covers adequate knowledge of Number systems. The course starts with the process of creating or developing algorithms/ flowcharts for solving different types of problems using a Computer. At a later stage, it covers programming constructs in C including data types, variables, operators, input/output, decision making, loops, arrays, functions, structures, dynamic memory allocations, file handling. Students also get hands on experience on Linux commands, and C programs in the laboratory. Towards the end of the course, students will be introduced to Python programming in a Procedural programming environment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Past Course Offerings:  1.

1.(IoT Security) Title: Lightweight Code Self-verification for Internet of Things (IoT) Devices, funded by MeitY-NWO under Indo-Dutch Joint Research programme for ICT, (2015-2020), Project outlay: 380, 000 Euros (INR 2.6 Crores).  Principal Investigators: Prof. Herbert Bos (Vrije University, Amsterdam), Prof. Chittaranjan Hota (BITS-Hyderabad)  Executive Summary: The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects (things) embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity modules to enable these objects to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with other connected devices. The IoT paradigm has been emerging for decades, with origins in factory automation, and embedded systems. The fascinating opportunities available through the usage of IoT today, could take any developing country’s economy to a larger sustainable economy by reducing food wastage, reducing energy consumption etc. Along with massive deployment of IoT systems come massive problems. The operation of IoT devices in non-controlled, possibly hostile environments puts the dependability and reliability of IoT systems at stake. More specifically, adversaries may tamper with the devices, intervene their communication channels or clone the devices, to instrument (engineer) the data gathering and overall operation of IoT systems to their own interest. The key idea of this proposal is to use the advanced exploitation technique of Return Oriented Programming (ROP), not as an offensive mechanism, but rather as a defensive weapon, to protect programs running in hostile and possibly resource constrained IoT environments against tampering by adversaries. Specifically, our code verification approach will protect code running on IoT devices by overlapping ROP gadgets (ROP chain) within the code. These translated functions will implicitly verify the integrity of the protected code, by malfunctioning if the ROP gadgets are tampered with, effectively acting as self-verifying code.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 





                                Completed Projects


1. (Cyber Security) Title: Automated Detection of Security and Privacy Threats in Peer-to-Peer Networks, funded by DeitY, Ministry of Communication & Information Technology, Govt. of India, New Delhi, March 2012, (March,2012 - June,2015), Amount: 61,95,000 INR. (Principal Investigator: Chittaranjan Hota). Executive Summary:  With the proliferation of P2P systems, it is critical to consider the impact of these systems on the security of an Internet environment that is already struggling from several security issues. The Indian IT act 2000 and 2008 have provisions for punishing cyber-crimes like hacking, denial of service, breach of confidentiality, publishing of fake digital certificate etc. Other developing, and developed countries have more or less similar regulations. However, most of the countries have less stringent regulations on P2P application usage. Empirical studies indicate that P2P and Web traffic together dominate today's Internet traffic. Currently, products like Snort, Sourcefire VRT etc. detect and alert policy violations for usage of P2P applications using techniques like port-based analysis, and protocol analysis. In this research, we have developed a research prototype to assess the impact of P2P traffic on perimeter security appliance, and also developed intelligent approaches to counter their impact on a large campus wide network.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. (Overlay Search) Title: Efficient Peer-to-Peer Overlay Infrastructure for Secure Computing
over the Internet, funded by University
Grants Commission (UGC),
Govt. of India, New Delhi: (2011 - 2014), Amount: 12,50,000 INR. (Principal
Investigator: Chittaranjan Hota) SUMMARY REPORT:OBJECTIVES: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks which connect peers on top of physical networks like IP, and be it over a wired or over a wireless medium, are growing dramatically in their usage. P2P application usage has grown steadily since its inception around the year 2000. Client-server based architectures are characterized by asymmetric relationship between client and server where client queries and server responds. Contrast to that in distributed P2P systems every node acts as both a server and a client. Peer-to-Peer overlay structure is brought to popularity by the file sharing applications like Napster, Gnutella etc. A P2P overlay network is a logical network built at application layer providing connectivity, routing, and messaging amongst addressable end-points of the communication. These overlay networks have been used for file sharing (torrents), voice over P2P (Skype), and streaming media (P2Pstream) in recent times. The spring 2011 global Internet phenomena report by Canadian ISP Sandvine points to the increased percentage of P2P traffic in North American fixed access networks from 15.1% in 2009 to 18.8% in 2011. In this project, authors have tried to achieve the following two objectives that are critical in improving the performance of large scale file sharing P2P overlays: A.To analyze existing protocols for location management (lookup problem) in peer-to-peer overlays and propose efficient approaches to reduce overlay maintenance cost and network congestion. Under this objective, the main goal is to develop lookup algorithms to optimize the decision making process at each peer by considering the locally available information at each peer like files uploaded/downloaded, bandwidth available, etc. and global information available like type of files at other peers, congestion in the network, replica availability at other peers etc. The target overlay is this research is unstructured P2P overlays mainly file sharing overlay networks.B.To propose novel algorithms to safeguard against Sybil attacks in Peer-to-Peer unstructured overlay networks. Sybil attacks are a major source of concern in any collaborative activity, and particularly in a file sharing P2P network. These attacks are mounted on a sophisticated scale where the attacker stills multiple identities and uses those to disturb the collaborative work. Using Sybil attack, attacker can spoil byzantine consensus, can drop forwarding packets to the neighbor peer, can forward the packets in a wrong route etc. Our objective in this part of the project to either detect these Sybil identities or reduce their impact on the overlay services.

A. Data Structures and Algorithms (CS F211): Pl. click here to go to the course page. Scope: A data structure is a collection of large amounts of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied on them. In order to be effective, data has to be organized in a manner that adds to the effectiveness of an algorithm, and data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, heaps, trees, and graphs provide different capabilities to organize and manage large amounts of data. While developing a program or an application, many developers find themselves more interested in the type of algorithm used rather than the type of data structure implemented. However, the choice of data structure used for a particular algorithm is always of paramount importance. For example, B-trees have unique abilities to organize indexes and hence are well suited for implementation of databases; Linked lists are well suited for backtracking algorithms like, accessing previous and next pages in a web browser; Graphs are well suited for path optimization algorithms (like in Google maps) or searching in a Social graph (like Facebook). As computers have become faster and faster, the problems they must solve have become larger and more complex, requiring development of more complex programs. Through this course, students will learn better programming and algorithm analysis skills using C++.   B. Computer Programming (CS F111): Pl click here to go to the course page.   Scope: This is an introductory course to computers and programming in ‘C’. This course uses a bottom-up approach to teach the beginners what is the structure of a computer and how it can be programmed. It also covers adequate knowledge of Number systems. The course starts with the process of creating or developing algorithms/ flowcharts for solving different types of problems using a Computer. At a later stage, it covers programming constructs in C including data types, variables, operators, input/output, decision making, loops, arrays, functions, structures, dynamic memory allocations, file handling. Students also get hands on experience on Linux commands, and C programs in the laboratory. Towards the end of the course, students will be introduced to Python programming in a Procedural programming environment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Past Course Offerings:  1.
