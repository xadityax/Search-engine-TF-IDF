Our group's research interest lies in “Organ targeted drug development and delivery” for ocular and urinary bladder diseases. One of the major challenge for successful ocular and urinary bladder therapeutics is to cross the Blood-Ocular Barrier and Blood-Urinary Barrier. Hence we are interested in answering how biological barriers affect the clinical success of the therapeutics and understanding the blood ocular / urine barrier to overcome it for delivering drugs across it for various diseases. Our current focus is on developing nanocarrier delivery system to deliver small and large molecules to the anterior and posterior segment of eye for treating various ocular diseases.   Research Areas  Product developmentOcular drug delivery Ocular pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (preclinical animal models)Ocular drug development/repurposing Membrane transporter targeted drug delivery  Intravesical drug delivery & pharmacokineticsNanomedicine   ·
