 Quantum optics and Quantum Information:  Applications of master equations in quantum optics:- In Quantum Mechanics the evolution of the quantum state is described by the Schrodinger Equationand it is a unitary evolution. In real word it is well known that it is not true. In general, when a mixed state is appended with an environment evolve unitarily giving rise to dissipation. A master equation is used to model the dissipation. The master equation lies at the heart of quantum optics. It describes the evolution of thedissipative systems. The master equation is used to model decoherence,entanglement sudden death, has found many applications in quantum optics  and openquantum systems . In quantum information, they are used to model quantum channelcapacities. A novel approach of solving master equation using thermo field dynamics is carried out.  Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is used to solve the master equation. This formalism has an important salientfeatures, the solving of master equation is reduced to solving a Schroedinger equation, thus allthe techniques available to solve the Schroedinger equation are applicable here. Hence, thesolving of master equation using TDF gives a very simple and elegant approach.   This methodology is applied to Entanglement in two-site Bose–Hubbard model with non-linear dissipation.We are looking its applications to Cold atoms and  Bose Einstein condensate (BEC). I have being also interested in, Gisin’s theorem and quantum channel capacities.  Mathematical Physics: Quantum Hamilton Jacobi, Exceptional Orthogonal Polynomials, Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. Random Matrix Theory : Random matrix approach to Quantum mechanics. Random matrix applications in quantum information : Extend Simon's criterion for Gaussian states to the multi-mode Gaussian states using the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. We show that the Marchenko-Pastur theorem from random matrix theory as necessary and sufficient condition for separability. I am also interested in  Random matrix applications to wireless communications. Nonlinear coherent states : Interested in the Berry-Phase for coherent states of nonlinear su(2) and su(1, 1) algebras. In quantum information.  Baryogenesis (Cosmology) : The baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) problem is a challenging one in thestandard model of cosmology. It is characterised by the ratio η =nb/ nγ , where nb is the numberof baryons and nγ is the number of photons in the universe. The present value of the asymmetryin the universe is η = 3 × 10−10 . Three conditions postulated by Sakharov are sufficient to guarantee baryon asymmetry.These are (i) Baryon number (B) violation, (ii) Charge (C) and Parity (CP) violation, (iii) thepresence of nonequilibrium processes. There  are several models explaining the value of η. I am interested in  supersymmetric Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, gravitational baryogenesis and  leptogenesis.
