 1.  Research Scholar TUMMALAPALLI SAHITHI Research Topic: Web Service Anti-pattern Prediction using Machine Learning TechniquesAbstract: In todays software industries, the concepts of Web Services are applied to design and develop distributed software system. These distributed software system can be designed and developed by integrating different Web Services provided by different parties. Similar to other software systems, Web Services based system also suffers from bad or poor design i.e., bad design selection, anti-pattern, poor planning etc.. Early prediction of anti-patterns can help developer and tester in fixing designissue and also effectively utilize the resources. The aim of our analysis is to empirically investigates  the application of machine learning techniques for predicting different types of anti-patterns. These all techniques are validated on 226 real-world web-services across several domains. MITHUN KUMAR  Research Topic: Testing of text prediction models
